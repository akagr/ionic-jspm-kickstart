Ionic bootstrap with JSPM
===========================

This is a simple boilerplate app with bower swapped out in favor of jspm. This
provides much powerful SystemJS async module loading and all ES6 goodness with
traceur support.


Setup
------------

* Install the global dependencies

```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova jspm
```

* Clone this repo and change into project directory

```bash
git clone git@github.com:akagr/ionic-jspm-kickstart.git
cd ionic-jspm-kickstart
```

* Install local dependencies

```bash
jspm install
```

* Start the app

```bash
ionic serve
```
